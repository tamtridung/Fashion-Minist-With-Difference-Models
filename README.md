# FASHION MINIST DATASET WITH DIFFERENCE MODELS

## Description:

In order to highlight what I have learnt about traditional Machine Learning, this a project to using legendary data set Minist Fashion to comparing the accuracy between 7 models,
- Logistic Regession
- XGBoost
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- SCV
- Adaboost
- KNN

## Techologies and Techniques
- Supervisor Machine Learning
- Python 3.8

## Result:

=> SVC and XGBoost give us the highest accuracy but XGBoost seem to be Over-fitting. So the best choice is SVC (in case we using traditional machine learning)
